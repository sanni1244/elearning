    <h3>Specific heat capacity</h3>
    <p>The specific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by a specific amount. It is typically measured in joules per gram per degree Celsius (J/gÂ°C). The specific heat capacity of a substance depends on the type of substance and its temperature. For example, water has a higher specific heat capacity than most other substances, meaning it requires more heat energy to raise its temperature. This is why water is often used to regulate temperature in processes such as cooling or heating.</p><br/>
