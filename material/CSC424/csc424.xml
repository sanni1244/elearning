    <h3>EXPERT SYSTEMS</h3>
    <p>Expert systems are a type of artificial intelligence that are designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular field. They are used in a variety of industries, from healthcare to finance to manufacturing, to make data-driven decisions that would be too complex or time-consuming for a human to make on their own.</p><br/>
    <p>One of the key components of expert systems is their ability to use rules and logic to analyze data and make decisions. These rules are typically developed by subject matter experts and encoded into the system through a process called knowledge engineering. The expert system then uses these rules to analyze data and make recommendations or decisions based on the data.</p><br/>
    <p>Expert systems have several advantages over traditional decision-making methods. They are able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, they can operate continuously without the need for breaks or vacation, and they are able to make consistent decisions based on the same set of rules every time. Additionally, expert systems can be easily updated as new data becomes available or as the rules for decision-making evolve.</p><br/>
    <p>One of the most common applications of expert systems is in healthcare. In this industry, expert systems are used to analyze patient data and make recommendations for treatment. For example, an expert system might be used to analyze a patient's medical history, test results, and current symptoms to recommend a course of treatment. This can be particularly useful in cases where a patient has a complex medical history or where multiple treatment options are available.</p><br/>
    <p>Expert systems are also used in the financial industry to analyze market trends and make investment recommendations. In this case, the expert system might analyze data such as stock prices, economic indicators, and company financial statements to make investment decisions. This can be particularly useful for investors who don't have the time or expertise to analyze this data themselves.</p><br/>
    <p>Expert systems are also used in manufacturing to optimize production processes and improve quality control. In this case, the expert system might analyze data such as production output, machine maintenance records, and quality control data to identify opportunities for process improvement. This can help manufacturers increase efficiency and reduce costs.</p><br/>
    <p>Despite their many advantages, expert systems also have some limitations. One of the main limitations is that they are only as good as the data and rules that are encoded into them. If the data is incomplete or the rules are not well-defined, the expert system may not be able to make accurate decisions. Additionally, expert systems may not be able to adapt to changing circumstances or unexpected events, as they are limited to the rules that have been encoded into them.</p><br/>
    <p>Another limitation of expert systems is that they can be expensive to develop and maintain. Knowledge engineering is a complex and time-consuming process, and the expert system may need to be updated regularly to reflect new data or changing rules. Additionally, expert systems may require specialized hardware and software to run, which can add to the overall cost.</p><br/>
